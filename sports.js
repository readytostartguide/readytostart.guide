        title: "Everyone at the court was a beginner once - don't be shy!",
        content: "Pickleball players are known for being incredibly welcoming. Just say 'I'm new, can I join?' and people will help you learn. Most courts have a mix of skill levels and beginners play together. The community aspect is what makes pickleball special."
      },
      {
        title: "You DON'T need to buy equipment for your first time",
        content: "Most community centers and clubs have paddles to borrow or rent for $2-5. Try different paddle weights before buying your own ($30-150). Court shoes are more important - tennis/court shoes prevent ankle injuries on the hard surface. Don't use running shoes."
      },
      {
        title: "The rules are simpler than they seem - you'll learn as you play",
        content: "Main rules: serve underhand, ball must bounce once on each side before volleying, stay out of the 'kitchen' (7-foot no-volley zone) unless ball bounces. That's 90% of what you need. Other players will remind you of rules during play - it's part of learning!"
      },
      {
        title: "Start with doubles, not singles - it's more forgiving",
        content: "Doubles gives you a partner to help and covers less court area. Singles is exhausting for beginners. Most recreational play is doubles anyway. You'll rotate partners every game so you meet everyone and learn different strategies."
      },
      {
        title: "Go during open play times for casual, mixed-skill games",
        content: "Check court schedule for 'open play' or 'drop-in' times (usually mornings 8-11 AM). These sessions are perfect for beginners. Avoid 'advanced play' times your first few visits. Weekday mornings tend to be friendliest for newcomers."
      },
      {
        title: "Bring water and expect to sweat - it's more intense than it looks!",
        content: "Games are quick (to 11 points) but you'll play multiple games back-to-back. It's more cardio than you expect. Bring a water bottle, towel, and maybe a backup shirt. Sunscreen if playing outdoors. Take breaks between games - no one will judge you."

        content: "Find your nearest court using the USA Pickleball court locator or local parks website. Check open play times - call ahead if unsure. Wear athletic shorts/pants, moisture-wicking shirt, and court shoes. Pack water, sunscreen (if outdoor), and a positive attitude!"

        title: "Arrival & Introduction (10-15 min)",
        content: "Arrive 10 minutes early to watch a game and see the pace. Introduce yourself: 'Hi, I'm new to pickleball, can I jump in?' Ask about paddle borrowing. Watch one game to see court positioning and basic rules in action. Most places have a beginner-friendly atmosphere."
      },
      {
        title: "First Game Warmup (5-10 min)",
        content: "Your first game will likely be a warmup rally - just hitting ball back and forth to get comfortable. Practice serving (easier than tennis - just an underhand toss). Get feel for paddle weight and ball speed. Partner or opponents will give you tips. No pressure!"
      },
      {
        title: "Playing Your First Games (30-45 min)",
        content: "Games to 11 points go fast (5-10 minutes each). You'll probably play 3-5 games in your first session. Rotate partners each game - this is normal! Focus on just getting paddle on ball, not winning. Position improves naturally. Call out score before serving (server's score first)."
      },
      {
        title: "Cool Down & Social Time (10-15 min)",
        content: "After playing, stay to chat - pickleball players are social! Ask about regular play times, local clubs, or friendly players to connect with. Many lasting friendships form on pickleball courts. Exchange numbers with other beginners to practice together."

        content: "New gym-goers worry about being judged, but gym regulars barely notice others - they're in their own zone. Everyone started as a beginner. If anyone does look your way, it's usually admiration for starting your fitness journey. Most gymgoers are supportive, not judgmental."

        title: "Get a FREE orientation tour - it's included with membership",
        content: "Every gym offers a complimentary walkthrough showing equipment, locker rooms, and basic usage. Staff will show you how machines work and answer questions. Schedule this for a slow time (weekday 2-3 PM) when staff has more time. Don't skip this - it builds confidence!"
      },
      {
        title: "Start with machines, not free weights - they're safer and easier",
        content: "Weight machines guide your movement and prevent injury. Free weights require technique knowledge. Spend first 2-3 weeks learning machines and building base strength. Each machine has instruction diagrams. Don't be shy to ask staff or nearby member for help."
      },
      {
        title: "Go during off-peak hours for your first few visits",
        content: "Avoid the packed 5-7 PM rush hour your first week. Try 10 AM-2 PM, or after 8 PM. Less crowded = easier to try equipment without waiting, more staff availability for questions, less intimidating atmosphere. Once comfortable, any time works fine."
      },
      {
        title: "Do LESS than you think you can - soreness is okay, pain is not",
        content: "Your first day, aim for 50% of what you think you can do. You'll be sore 2 days later (delayed onset muscle soreness is normal). Better to finish feeling good than overdo it and be unable to walk for a week. Gradually increase intensity over weeks."
      },
      {
        title: "Gym etiquette basics: wipe equipment, don't hog machines, rerack weights",
        content: "Bring towel to wipe sweat off benches/seats after use. Limit time on popular equipment during busy hours (15 minutes). Return dumbbells and plates to their spots. Don't drop weights loudly. These basics show respect and you'll fit right in."

        title: "Arrival & Check-in (10 min)",

      {
        title: "Warmup & Familiarization (10 min)",
        content: "Start with 5-10 minutes on treadmill or bike at easy pace to warm up muscles. Use this time to observe gym layout, where equipment is, how busy different areas are. Read machine instruction diagrams. Identify a few machines you want to try today."

        title: "Tell the instructor you're new BEFORE class starts - they'll help you!",
        content: "Arrive 10 minutes early, introduce yourself: 'This is my first yoga class.' Instructor will keep eye on you, offer modifications, and check in after class. They'll also tell you where to set up your mat (beginners near front can see better, near back feels less exposed - your choice!)."
      },
      {
        title: "You're supposed to be wobbly and inflexible - that's literally why you're here!",
        content: "Yoga is not a flexibility competition. Can't touch your toes? Normal. Wobbling in tree pose? Everyone does. Using blocks and straps? That's what they're for. Progress happens over weeks and months. Instructors love seeing beginners grow, not judging where you start."
      },
      {
        title: "Start with 'Beginner,' 'Gentle,' or 'Hatha' yoga - NOT Power or Vinyasa",
        content: "Class names matter! Beginner/Gentle/Hatha = slow-paced, explained well. Power/Vinyasa/Hot = fast, assumes knowledge, can be overwhelming. Yin/Restorative = very slow, lots of floor poses (also good for beginners). Check studio schedule and ask staff for first-timer recommendations."
      },
      {
        title: "Wear fitted (not baggy) clothes - you'll understand why in downward dog",
        content: "Loose shirts fall over your head in inversions. Baggy pants make it hard to see alignment. Form-fitting leggings/tops let you and instructor see your body positioning. Don't need expensive yoga brands - any athletic wear works. Skip belt buckles or loose drawstrings."
      },
      {
        title: "It's okay to rest in child's pose anytime - it's not 'giving up'",
        content: "Child's pose (kneeling, forehead on mat, arms forward) is a resting position you can take ANY time during class if you need a break. Taking a rest shows body awareness, not weakness. Good yoga is about listening to your body, not pushing through everything."

        title: "Breathing is harder than it looks - don't stress about getting it 'right'",
        content: "Instructor will cue 'inhale' and 'exhale' - just do your best. If you lose the rhythm, just breathe normally until you can sync back up. Even experienced yogis sometimes breathe opposite of cues. As long as you're breathing (not holding breath), you're doing fine!"

        title: "Before Class (30 min - 1 day ahead)",
        content: "Book class online or call studio - many limit class size. Don't eat heavy meal 2 hours before (light snack okay). Remove jewelry that might dig into skin. Bring water bottle. Arrive 15 minutes early for first class to check in, meet instructor, set up space. Most studios provide mats."
      },
      {
        title: "Arrival & Setup (10-15 min before class)",
        content: "Check in at desk, tell them you're new. Ask about mat rental (usually free or $1-2). Instructor may introduce themselves - mention you're a first-timer. Choose mat spot (near front to see teacher better, or back/side if you're shy). Remove shoes, sit quietly on mat."

        title: "Class Beginning - Centering (5-10 min)",
        content: "Class starts seated or lying down with breathing and gentle stretches. Instructor explains class structure. This is your time to settle in and calm nerves. Focus on your breath. Instructor might say namaste or om - participation optional, just be respectful."
      },
      {
        title: "Main Practice - Poses & Flows (30-40 min)",
        content: "Instructor demonstrates each pose then cues class through it. Common beginner poses: cat/cow, downward dog, warrior poses, tree pose. Transitions between poses get easier with practice. Modifications always offered - take them! Use blocks, take breaks, ask for help. You're doing great!"

        title: "Savasana & Closing (5-10 min)",
        content: "Class ends lying on back in 'corpse pose' (savasana) - full body relaxation for 5 minutes. Stay as still as possible, rest. This is important recovery time. Instructor ends with namaste (return bow is respectful). Congrats - you did it! Ask instructor any questions after class."
